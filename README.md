## Puzzle overview

The central role of our puzzle plays a "radio".
The radio consists of a touchscreen display, a speaker, a module to play sound from an sd card, three encoders for tuning as well as one for the volume. The devices are all connected to a ESP32 WROOM Development kit. 
Final aim of the puzzle is to retrieve the so-called "green code" which is needed in a combination to restart the final server, i.e. to succeed in playining the Escape Room. 
It is to be discussed if the radio will maybe deliver more information, e.g. hints for the next puzzle (Morse-Code sound to open the server room door). 
The green code will eventually be displayed on the radio screen, once all the radio-related puzzles have been solved. The puzzles to be solved include the correct positioning of the three encoders which results in a change of the radio station.
The new channel also comes with a new radio display screen. Solving a word game now leads to the final green code.

## Fitting the Puzzle into the story

The radio belongs to the hobby funker and former power distribution worker Ferdi. 
He has been fired a few years ago due to automatisation and digitalization of the distribution center. Ever since he has been fired, the work in the control room had been done autonomously. Ferdi has always predicted that the full autonoumous room can be dangerous in the future because nobody knows how to fix things if something goes wrong.
